-- 245 — report_pins: the saved reports one person keeps in their rail
--
-- ADR-0104 D2, as written.
--
-- A pin targets EITHER a saved report OR a catalog preset by key, and exactly
-- one of the two. The second half matters more than it first appears: without
-- it the only way into the rail is to SAVE something, which means inventing a
-- name for "the report I always look at". Pinning is how a canned report
-- reaches the rail without being named, which is what lets D1 keep a single
-- Reports destination instead of listing everything.
--
-- A CATALOG PIN STORES ONLY THE KEY. The preset's name and spec live in the
-- SPA's own catalog, so improving a preset never needs a data migration and a
-- pin follows the definition rather than freezing a copy of it. The trade is
-- that a key the client no longer knows renders nothing — which is the right
-- failure: a retired preset should disappear from the rail, not persist as an
-- entry that opens a report nobody maintains.
--
-- PER USER, NOT PER LEDGER. Two people on one ledger do not share a rail: a
-- pin is "I come back to this", which is not a property of the report and not
-- something its author gets to decide for everyone. Note the asymmetry this
-- creates with saved_reports.visibility — a ledger-shared report can be pinned
-- by someone who cannot edit it, and unpinning is theirs alone.
--
-- WHY THE COMPOSITE FK. ledger_id is denormalized so snapshot capture can
-- chunk on it (fn_snapshot_write_part uses a generic WHERE t.ledger_id = $1),
-- and the composite reference to saved_reports(id, ledger_id) is what makes
-- that column a DERIVED fact rather than an assertion — the same reasoning
-- migrations 072 and 243 give. saved_reports had no such candidate key, so one
-- is added here; that mirrors what migration 049 did for securities when its
-- derivative tables needed the same guarantee.
--
-- CAPTURED IN SNAPSHOTS, following saved_reports and user_account_groups.
-- Restoring a ledger and finding every report still there but nobody's rail
-- intact would be a loss the schema never admitted to. The drift guard forces
-- the choice to be explicit anyway, so the six bodies are re-emitted below.
